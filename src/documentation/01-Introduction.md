# **Introduction**

This documentation will explore common uses of TypeScript in React.
Each topic will be covered with additionals code examples.

## **About This Documentation**

You'll learn with examples, how to use TypeScript with React.
It is not a course on TypeScript itself.
You have to know the fundamentals of React.

## **Why TypeScript + React?**

-   With static type checking, you get to learn about potential bugs
    as you're typing the code. than heading to the browser and figuring
    out at runtime.

-   Privides a way to describe the shape of an object hence providing better
    documentation and autocomplete.

-   Makes maintenance and refactoring of large code bases much easier.

-   Many job positions nowadays require TypeScript knowledge.

## **TypeScript Common Complains**

-   TypeScript is just frustrating most of the times.

-   I have to write a lot more code than I normally do and the compiler keeps
    complaining. I simply don't know what to do about those errors.

-   It doesn't seem to be productive for me.

**These are common negative opinions about TypeScript but with the rignth
knowledge and preparation those issues dissappear. TypeScript is an
initial investement that pays off in the long run**

### **This project is my documentation/notes for my personal learning. All the examples and explanantion comes from Codevolution**
