## **Getting Started**

So let's crate our working sandbox where we will explore common TypeScript usages in React.
Create a folder and then open it in any IDE of your choice.

First we will need a default React app with TypeScript installed.

```npm
npx create-react-app react-typescript-course --template typescript
```

This command should create for us a default React app teplate.
Install all the dependencies and open this app on the localhost.

```npm
npm run start
```

index.tsx is the entry point to our app. First thing to notice is that instead of .jsx we create
components with .tsx extesion.

Now before we will move to exploring props subject we need to make small cleanup in the App.tsx file.
Make sure all the default JSX is removed to make space for the components we'll create in the next part.
Create compnentes foldet that will contain all of our examples.
